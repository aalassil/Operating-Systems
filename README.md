This repository features a collection of my projects focused on operating systems. It includes implementations of various synchronization techniques and process scheduling strategies to address classic concurrency issues, such as the Dining Philosophers problem. These projects demonstrate practical solutions to real-world challenges in operating system design and functionality.
